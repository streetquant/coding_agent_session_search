//! Machine-responsiveness governor for the indexing pipeline.
//!
//! The indexer can easily saturate every core of a big host. That is normally
//! fine on a dedicated build box, but on a shared workstation it makes
//! interactive shells, editors, and a foreground `cass search` feel dead
//! while a rebuild runs. This module provides a lightweight, hysteresis-aware
//! governor that publishes a *capacity factor* (an integer percentage in
//! `[min_capacity_pct, 100]`). Callers consult [`effective_worker_count`]
//! before committing to a worker fan-out, and get back a bounded count that
//! respects the current system load.
//!
//! Design goals (aligned with bead `coding_agent_session_search-d2qix`):
//!
//! * **Conservative by default.** Defaults never grow past caller-requested
//!   fan-out; they only shrink when the box is already under pressure.
//! * **Explainable.** Thresholds live in named env vars and the full decision
//!   history is queryable via [`telemetry_snapshot`].
//! * **Non-oscillating.** Shrink is immediate so responsiveness recovers
//!   fast, but growth back to full capacity requires multiple consecutive
//!   healthy ticks (hysteresis) so flapping loads do not flap the worker count.
//! * **Opt-out.** `CASS_RESPONSIVENESS_DISABLE=1` pins capacity to 100% for
//!   before/after comparison runs and sandboxed environments.
//!
//! Signals read on Linux:
//!
//! * `/proc/loadavg` first field (1-minute load average), compared against
//!   the number of logical CPUs.
//! * `/proc/pressure/cpu` `some avg10` (percent of wall-time some task was
//!   delayed on CPU in the last 10s). This is the best single "how
//!   unresponsive does the machine feel" signal available from the kernel.
//!
//! On macOS only the load-average signal is available (`sysctl -n vm.loadavg`);
//! there is no PSI equivalent. On other platforms the reader always reports
//! healthy, so the governor reduces to a no-op.
//!
//! Scheduled maintenance (`cass schedule run`, `cass models backfill
//! --scheduled`, the daemon's periodic index spawn) can additionally require
//! console idle time via `CASS_RESPONSIVENESS_MIN_USER_IDLE_SECS` — see
//! [`user_idle_gate`]. That gate is deliberately *not* consulted by foreground
//! indexing: a human who typed `cass index` wants it to run now.

//! Corrupt-archive recovery surfaces for `cass doctor` (#285).
//!
//! When the read-only pre-index health gate refuses to index because the
//! canonical `agent_search.db` is corrupt, the operator previously hit a wall:
//! `doctor repair` refuses an unreadable archive, a stock-sqlite `.recover`
//! rebuild is rejected by frankensqlite on readonly open, and the only working
//! path was a hand-rolled JSONL reconstruction from cass's own preserved
//! events. This module turns that working recovery into first-class commands:
//!
//! * [`run_doctor_recover_from_archive`] rebuilds the source JSONL tree from the
//!   canonical archive's preserved `extra_json`/`extra_bin` envelopes so the
//!   data can be re-ingested into a fresh, frankensqlite-native archive — no
//!   `.recover` and no external SQLite tool needed.
//! * [`run_doctor_rebuild_canonical_fts`] inspects exact FTS5 parity, resumes
//!   partial shadows in bounded batches, transactionally creates an absent
//!   shadow, and refuses destructive in-place work on unqueryable artifacts.
//! * [`run_doctor_cleanup_interrupted_artifacts`] quarantines interrupted
//!   `raw_mirror_capture` staging dirs that otherwise block doctor mutation,
//!   without forcing the operator to `rm` inside cass's own data dir.
//!
//! None of these surfaces ever delete canonical rows or source data: recovery
//! is additive (writes reconstructed files), the FTS5 shadow is fully
//! rebuildable from the canonical `messages`, and interrupted artifacts are
//! moved into a quarantine dir rather than deleted.

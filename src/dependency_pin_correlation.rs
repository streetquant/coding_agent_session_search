//! Dependency-pin and upstream-fix correlation for CASS diagnostics.
//!
//! Bead: coding_agent_session_search-cass-fleet-resilience-20260608-uojcg.9.4
//! ("Track dependency pins and upstream fix correlation in diagnostics").
//!
//! CASS pins ecosystem crates (frankensqlite, frankensearch, asupersync, …) by
//! exact registry requirement or git revision. When a symptom shows up — e.g. a frankensqlite FTS/`OpenRead`
//! failure — the right diagnostic answer is often "this is already fixed upstream
//! in rev X; your pin is behind" or "your local checkout is dirty/patched, so the
//! pinned rev is not what is actually running". This module makes that correlation
//! explicit instead of leaving an operator to guess from CASS source symptoms.
//!
//! It is pure logic over inputs a probe gathers ([`PinObservation`]): the pinned
//! rev from `Cargo.toml`/lock, the observed local rev (when a sibling checkout is
//! present and readable), and whether the working tree is dirty. No network and
//! no filesystem access happen here — `no-network mode` is simply the case where
//! `observed_local_rev` is `None`. It composes with the root-cause taxonomy
//! (`9.1`) via [`RootCauseFamily`] so a correlated known issue can be attributed.

//! Synchronous facade over the async Quill lexical engine.
//!
//! CASS's lexical layer is synchronous because Tantivy is synchronous. Quill is
//! `asupersync`-async. Rather than colour 54k lines of indexer call sites with
//! `async fn`, this module drives each Quill future to completion on the calling
//! thread — the same bridge pattern [`crate::franken_sync`] already uses for the
//! async FrankenSQLite engine, for exactly the same reason.
//!
//! The runtime lives in a thread-local slot and is *taken out* while a future is
//! being driven, so a reentrant bridge call finds the slot empty and builds a
//! fresh runtime instead of re-entering `block_on` on the same instance.
//! `Runtime::block_on` has no `Send` bound and saves/restores the ambient
//! runtime handle, so nesting inside a consumer's own `block_on` is safe.
//!
//! Every future is created, polled, and dropped entirely within one bridge
//! call, so engine state never crosses a thread boundary between poll steps.

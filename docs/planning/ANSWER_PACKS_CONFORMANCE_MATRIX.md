# Answer-Pack Conformance Matrix

**Spec:** `docs/planning/ANSWER_PACKS_CONTRACT.md`
**Bead:** `coding_agent_session_search-uuwye.6`
**Status:** Partial implementation evidence; full contract reconciliation remains open
**Date:** 2026-09-05 UTC (original coverage map: 2026-05-08)

This matrix turns the answer-pack contract into testable requirements. It is not
evidence of conformance by itself. A row is conformant only when the named test
exists, passes, and asserts the contract behavior directly instead of relying on
a proxy signal.

`Current Tested` counts rows with full contract-surface coverage. Planner-only
unit tests are recorded in the row status and evidence ledger, but they do not
count as pack conformance until the command, renderer, schema, and golden
surfaces exist.

## Idea-Wizard Artifact Map

This section is the durable phase-4/phase-6 overlap check for the answer-pack
idea-wizard run. The epic notes record that phases 2 and 3 generated the best
15 ideas; this table maps each idea to the current bead graph so future agents
can refine the plan without reconstructing the original prompt exchange.

| Rank | Idea | Current Bead Coverage | Phase-6 Verdict |
|------|------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Deterministic answer packs for swarm handoffs | `coding_agent_session_search-uuwye`, `.1`, `.2`, `.3`, `.5` | Covered. Keep planner, renderers, and CLI separate so agents can ship and test them in dependency order. |
| 2 | Freshness and SLO proof on handoffs | `.4`, `.8` | Covered. Health/readiness metadata and latency budgets stay separate because correctness and performance need different fixtures. |
| 3 | Privacy-safe evidence bundles | `.9`, `.7`, conformance rows AP-PRIV-* | Covered, but must stay blocking for CLI exposure so early robot users do not receive unredacted handoff artifacts. |
| 4 | Contract and golden gates | `.6`, this matrix, `ANSWER_PACKS_CONTRACT.md` | Covered. Planner-only evidence remains explicitly non-conformant until command, renderer, schema, and no-mock layers exist. |
| 5 | No-mock e2e handoff fixtures | `.7`, `.6` | Covered. The fixture must index real temporary sessions and prove source logs are not mutated. |
| 6 | Source-readiness metadata | `.4`, AP-HEALTH-* rows | Covered. Reuse `health` and `status` truth surfaces instead of creating a pack-only readiness model. |
| 7 | TOON and Markdown output | `.3`, `.5`, AP-FMT-* rows | Covered. JSON remains canonical; Markdown and TOON are format projections with equality/golden gates. |
| 8 | `--sessions-from` stdin/file input | `.5`, AP-CMD-007 | Covered. Needs CLI tests for stdin, file input, and invalid paths without inventing a new session resolver. |
| 9 | Token-budget diagnostics | `.2`, `.6`, `.8`, AP-BUDGET-* rows | Covered. Budget behavior must be unit-tested before performance SLOs can be trusted. |
| 10 | Schema introspection and robot-docs discovery | `.5`, `.10`, AP-CMD-002, AP-GATE-* | Covered. `cass introspect --json` and `robot-docs` must expose pack without requiring source reads. |
| 11 | Omitted-item reasons | `.2`, `.3`, AP-OMIT-* rows | Covered. Omission reasons are part of the robot contract, not just internal planner diagnostics. |
| 12 | Deterministic ordering and tie-breaks | `.2`, `.6`, AP-SEL-* rows | Covered. Keep input-order stability, null timestamp ordering, and later tie-break cases explicit. |
| 13 | Field masks for minimal/standard/full outputs | `.5`, `.6`, AP-MASK-* rows | Covered. Mask behavior belongs in CLI/golden tests because consumers depend on exact payload shape. |
| 14 | Boundary/non-goal guarantees | `.6`, `.7`, AP-BOUND-* rows | Covered. Pack must not call external LLMs, auto-download models, mutate source logs, run doctor fixes, or clean derived assets. |
| 15 | Operator and agent docs | `.10`, AP-GATE-* rows | Covered. Docs should land after contracts and tests so examples match the shipped command. |

No additional beads are needed for these ideas at this time. If a future phase-6
pass finds a new requirement, it should first extend this matrix or the
contract, then update `.beads` with `br` only after active metadata reservations
are clear.

## Requirement Matrix

| ID | Level | Contract Source | Requirement | Planned Coverage | Status |

| AP-CMD-009 | MUST | Input Flags | `--redaction off` marks `privacy.redaction_policy="off"` and `sensitive_output=true`. | Privacy unit test and JSON golden. | Planned |
| AP-CMD-010 | MUST | Input Flags | `--require-evidence` turns an empty pack into `err.kind="not-found"` with code 13. | CLI fixture with no hits. | Planned |
| AP-CMD-011 | MUST | Input Flags | `--explain-selection` exposes score components and omission diagnostics. | Planner unit test plus full field-mask golden. | Planned |
| AP-CMD-012 | MUST | Input Flags | `--refresh` runs only the existing safe incremental refresh path before packing. | CLI integration fixture that snapshots index/quarantine state and verifies no hidden repair path runs. | Planned |
| AP-CMD-013 | MUST | Input Flags | `--timeout <ms>` marks usable partial packs as partial and returns timeout/partial errors truthfully when no usable pack can be emitted. | Timeout fixture covering partial success and no-pack failure. | Planned |
| AP-MASK-001 | MUST | Field Masks | `standard` includes exactly the documented top-level fields. | JSON schema/golden assertion. | Planned |
| AP-MASK-002 | MUST | Field Masks | `minimal` includes only the documented dotted fields. | Minimal mask golden. | Planned |
| AP-MASK-003 | MUST | Field Masks | `full` includes all defined response fields and `selection_debug` only when requested. | Full mask golden pair. | Planned |
| AP-MASK-004 | MUST | Field Masks | Unknown explicit mask fields are ignored with `_meta.warnings[]` and exit 0. | CLI warning test. | Planned |
| AP-MASK-005 | MUST | Field Masks | Explicit field masks with no valid fields fail with `err.kind="pack-invalid-field"`. | CLI error-envelope test with all-invalid field list. | Planned |
| AP-SCHEMA-001 | MUST | JSON Response Schema | All object keys are stable and snake_case. | Golden plus schema walk rejecting non-snake keys. | Planned |
| AP-SCHEMA-002 | MUST | JSON Response Schema | `_meta.partial`, format, request id, generated time, elapsed time, and warnings are present. | Scrubbed JSON golden. | Planned |
| AP-SCHEMA-003 | MUST | JSON Response Schema | `realized` truthfully reports search mode, fallback, semantic join, candidates, selected evidence, and selected sessions. | Fixture covering lexical fallback and semantic unavailable. | Planned |
| AP-EV-001 | MUST | Evidence Item Schema | Evidence ids use `ev_<base32(blake3(citation core))>` and are stable. | `evidence_ids_encode_the_full_digest_as_base32` checks independent known answers and preservation of the final hash bit. The source-verification tests cover stable/rebound IDs; the real structured-pack fixture independently decodes the complete digest and checks references across JSON, compact, JSONL and TOON. Gate Z passed these checks; mandatory UBS remains unresolved. | Unit/CLI Partial |
| AP-EV-002 | MUST | Evidence Item Schema | Evidence rank is one-indexed final pack rank. | Planner ordering unit test. | Planned |
| AP-EV-003 | MUST | Evidence Item Schema | Excerpts are UTF-8-safe, redacted before token estimation, and mark truncation. | `pack_redacts_credentials_before_excerpt_truncation` and `pack_budgets_emitted_text_after_redaction_expansion_and_unicode`; complete CLI privacy-policy matrix remains. | Unit Partial |
| AP-EV-004 | MUST | Evidence Item Schema | Every selected evidence item includes citation, selection, roles, matched terms, and redactions fields. | JSON schema/golden assertion. | Planned |
| AP-CIT-001 | MUST | Citation Fields | Citation carries path, source id, origin kind, workspace, agent, line/message positions, ids, hashes, timestamps, match type, and verification status. | Citation schema test with complete fixture. | Planned |
| AP-CIT-002 | MUST | Citation Fields | Citation path and line fields resolve to readable source lines in the no-mock fixture. | `structured_pack_preserves_stale_checkpoint_and_returns_real_citations` verifies physical local Codex lines and raw-line hashes, then preserves archived evidence after moving the source. `structured_pack_shortens_large_evidence_without_losing_verified_citations` also verifies ingestion-redacted evidence; unit negatives reject ambiguous redacted records, changed content and mismatched timestamps. Other providers and the citation-path privacy contract remain. | Unit/CLI Partial |
| AP-CIT-003 | MUST | Citation Fields | `match_type` uses the existing search robot spelling, not Rust debug variant names. | Aggregation/pack regression for `implicit_wildcard`. | Planned |
| AP-PACK-001 | MUST | Pack Object Schema | Pack title, answer outline, source summary, and handoff are deterministic display scaffolding, not LLM summaries. | Unit fixture comparing exact output from fixed evidence. | Planned |
| AP-PACK-002 | MUST | Pack Object Schema | Outline headings are deterministic from matched terms and labels. | Planner/render unit test. | Planned |
| AP-PACK-003 | MUST | Pack Object Schema | Source summaries include source id, origin kind, session count, evidence count, newest timestamp, and health. | Source readiness fixture. | Planned |
| AP-PACK-004 | MUST | Pack Object Schema | Handoff items use allowed kinds and cite supporting evidence ids. | Renderer schema test. | Planned |
| AP-SEL-001 | MUST | Deterministic Selection | Candidate over-fetch uses `max(max_evidence * 8, max_sessions * 16, 64)` capped at 2048. | Planner config unit test. | Planned |
| AP-SEL-002 | MUST | Deterministic Selection | Score uses the documented component weights and duplicate penalty. | Score-component unit test. | Planned |
| AP-SEL-003 | MUST | Deterministic Selection | Tie-break order is stable across equal score, relevance, timestamp, source, path, line, and content hash. | `stable_tie_breaks_do_not_depend_on_input_order` covers input-order stability through source path; table cases for every later tie-break remain. | Unit Partial |
| AP-SEL-004 | MUST | Deterministic Selection | Null timestamps sort last in tie-breaks and score according to freshness policy. | `strict_freshness_omits_stale_or_unknown_timestamps` covers strict stale/unknown omission; prefer-recent null tie-break still needs a direct case. | Unit Partial |
| AP-SEL-005 | MUST | Deterministic Selection | Diversity scoring changes as selected sources and sessions accumulate. | `source_diversity_changes_second_pick` covers the greedy second-pick source diversity decision. | Planner Unit Passing |
| AP-SEL-006 | MUST | Deterministic Selection | Duplicate penalties cover span hash, content hash, and overlapping source ranges. | `duplicate_content_is_omitted_after_first_selection` covers content-hash duplicate omission; span-hash and range-overlap cases remain. | Unit Partial |
| AP-SEL-007 | MUST | Selection Fields | Without `--explain-selection`, `selection` exposes only score, token cost, and selected reason. | JSON golden pair with and without explain-selection. | Planned |
| AP-OMIT-001 | MUST | Omitted Item Schema | Omitted rows include stable candidate id, source path, line, agent, reason, score, and estimated tokens. | Omission schema unit test. | Planned |
| AP-OMIT-002 | MUST | Omitted Reasons | Reasons are exactly the documented snake_case values. | Enum serialization/schema test. | Planned |
| AP-OMIT-003 | MUST | Omitted Reasons | Hard-omitted candidates are emitted once and removed from future consideration. | `duplicate_content_is_omitted_after_first_selection` covers the duplicate-content hard omission; stale/redacted variants remain. | Unit Partial |
| AP-OMIT-004 | MUST | Omitted Reasons | Budget-omitted candidates are emitted once and not later emitted as max evidence. | `exact_token_budget_boundary_selects_until_budget_exhausted` covers token-budget omission at the exact boundary. | Unit Partial |
| AP-BUDGET-001 | MUST | Token Budget | Token estimates use ceil UTF-8 char count divided by four after redaction and truncation. | `pack_budgets_emitted_text_after_redaction_expansion_and_unicode` checks actual emitted text, item costs, sum and evidence budget; CLI budget tests cover valid/invalid caps and totals. Complete policy/format coverage remains. | Unit/CLI Partial |
| AP-BUDGET-002 | MUST | Token Budget | Budget reserves 15% metadata, 15% outline, 60% evidence, 10% omitted/warnings. | Planner budget unit test. | Planned |
| AP-BUDGET-003 | MUST | Token Budget | Planner shortens excerpts before dropping evidence. | Selection tests cover Unicode/ellipsis boundaries and shortening after ingestion redaction. `final_output_reduction_preserves_citations_and_reconciles_dropped_evidence` also checks final-output shortening, then omission and reconciled counters; the real CLI budget fixture requires measured final-output reduction across five formats. Full contract coverage remains. | Unit/CLI Partial |
| AP-BUDGET-004 | MUST | Token Budget | Selected evidence never loses citation fields to fit budget. | Planner tests retain the original candidate and ID. The real CLI shortening fixture compares citation fields across large/small budgets and independently checks emitted excerpt SHA-256. The five-format CLI fixture verifies nonempty surviving evidence against original source lines and BLAKE3 hashes with unchanged archive/source bytes. Positive goldens and broader provider coverage remain. | Unit/CLI Partial |
| AP-BUDGET-005 | MUST | Token Budget | Output may exceed max tokens by no more than 5%; otherwise drop another item or return `pack-budget-too-small`. | Final admission measures the actual encoded, projected output including runtime metadata, escaping and trailing newline using the contract's character-count estimator. Unit tests cover exact boundaries for all five formats and masked metadata; real CLI tests enforce the complete stdout bound, preserve required evidence, and reject oversized metadata with exit 2, nonretryable `pack-budget-too-small` and empty stdout. The existing budget sweep now measures stdout too. Central error-kind registration and full conformance remain open. | Unit/CLI Partial |
| AP-HEALTH-001 | MUST | Freshness and Health Proof | Health fields come from the same truth surfaces as `cass health --json` and `cass status --json`. | Fixture with stubbed existing health/status surfaces, not ad hoc values. | Planned |
| AP-HEALTH-002 | MUST | Freshness and Health Proof | Required health fields include healthy, recommended action, index state, semantic state, fallback mode, active rebuild, and source readiness. | Health schema golden. | Planned |
| AP-HEALTH-003 | MUST | Freshness and Health Proof | Source readiness includes source id, origin kind, healthy, last sync, last indexed, and recommended action. | Source readiness fixture. | Planned |
| AP-HEALTH-004 | MUST | Freshness and Health Proof | Missing semantic assets with ready lexical search succeed as lexical fallback. | Semantic-absent conformance fixture. | Planned |
| AP-HEALTH-005 | MUST | Freshness and Health Proof | Explicit `--mode semantic` warns or errors truthfully when semantic is unavailable. | CLI semantic unavailable test. | Planned |
| AP-PRIV-001 | MUST | Privacy Contract | Default redaction policy is strict. | JSON golden. | Planned |
| AP-PRIV-002 | MUST | Privacy Contract | Strict redaction masks all listed secret classes and skill content unless explicitly included. | Privacy fixture matrix. | Planned |
| AP-PRIV-003 | MUST | Privacy Contract | Balanced redaction preserves non-secret identifiers and short hashes while still redacting credential classes. | Privacy fixture matrix. | Planned |
| AP-PRIV-004 | MUST | Privacy Contract | Redaction never changes citation path or line fields. | Redaction/citation invariant test. | Planned |
| AP-PRIV-005 | MUST | Privacy Contract | Redaction preserves UTF-8 validity. | Unicode secret fixture. | Planned |
| AP-PRIV-006 | MUST | Privacy Contract | Redaction events include kind, start char, end char, and replacement. | Redaction event schema test. | Planned |
| AP-PRIV-007 | MUST | Privacy Contract | `privacy.redaction_applied=true` when any excerpt changes. | `render_pack_redacts_api_keys_and_bearer_tokens_in_json_and_markdown` checks one recorded redaction pass and the SHA-256 of emitted excerpt text. Other secret/path/host/encrypted-payload renderer cases pass; full CLI policy coverage remains. | Renderer Partial |
| AP-PRIV-008 | MUST | Privacy Contract | Fully redacted candidates are omitted with `redacted_to_empty`. | Redaction unit test. | Planned |
| AP-PRIV-009 | MUST | Privacy Contract | Pack never reads `.env` directly and includes `.env` content only when indexed evidence passes policy. | No-mock fixture with `.env` file present and indexed secret text. | Planned |
| AP-PRIV-010 | MUST | Privacy Contract | Skill payload excerpts are included only when `--include-skill-content` is explicitly set. | Privacy fixture pair for default exclusion and explicit inclusion. | Planned |
| AP-PRIV-011 | MUST | Privacy Contract | `--redaction off` is accepted only for local operator workflows and is visibly marked sensitive. | CLI/privacy fixture for allowed local use and rejected non-local use. | Planned |
| AP-ERR-001 | MUST | Error Contract | Errors use existing `CliError` envelope and kebab-case `err.kind`. | Error-envelope tests for every pack kind. | Planned |
| AP-ERR-002 | MUST | Error Contract | Consumers can branch on `err.kind`; numeric code alone is not relied on. | Introspect/docs schema test. | Planned |
| AP-ERR-003 | MUST | Error Contract | Empty search results succeed by default with `no_evidence_found`. | Empty fixture golden. | Planned |
| AP-ERR-004 | MUST | Error Contract | `pack-invalid-field`, `pack-budget-too-small`, `partial-result`, and `timeout` use documented codes, retryability, and hints. | Table-driven error-envelope regression. | Planned |
| AP-FMT-001 | MUST | Format Contracts | Pretty JSON and compact JSON contain the same fields. | `structured_pack_preserves_stale_checkpoint_and_returns_real_citations` compares stable citation/excerpt fields and pack/omitted/privacy sections across actual JSON and compact commands. Freshness age varies between invocations; full-envelope equality remains. | CLI Partial |
| AP-FMT-002 | MUST | Format Contracts | JSONL emits meta, pack, evidence items, omitted, and privacy in documented order. | The real structured-pack fixture asserts exact JSONL record count/order and evidence/reference equality with JSON; `render_jsonl_empty_pack_matches_golden_line_order` covers empty output. A dedicated JSONL golden remains. | Unit/CLI Partial |
| AP-FMT-003 | MUST | Format Contracts | TOON encodes the same payload through the existing `toon` crate path. | The real structured-pack fixture decodes TOON and compares stable citation/excerpt fields and pack/omitted/privacy with JSON using the encoder's numeric value model. Full-envelope equality remains. | CLI Partial |
| AP-FMT-004 | MUST | Format Contracts | Markdown includes inline evidence ids and an evidence section with path and line range. | Markdown golden. | Planned |
| AP-FMT-005 | MUST | Format Contracts | JSON goldens land before Markdown is treated as conformant. | Gate checklist in test docs. | Planned |
| AP-BOUND-001 | MUST | Implementation Boundaries | CLI parsing follows existing `src/lib.rs` patterns. | Code review checklist and CLI tests. | Planned |
| AP-BOUND-002 | MUST | Implementation Boundaries | Selection logic reuses `SearchClient` and existing filters instead of duplicating index logic. | Unit test via injected search outputs plus code review. | Planned |
| AP-BOUND-003 | MUST | Implementation Boundaries | New SQLite access uses frankensqlite only. | `rg "rusqlite"` delta check plus review. | Planned |
| AP-BOUND-004 | MUST | Implementation Boundaries | Session spans are read through existing view/expand-style helpers where possible. | Citation resolution integration test. | Planned |
| AP-BOUND-005 | MUST | Implementation Boundaries | Pack does not mutate source logs, indexes, quarantine directories, or health state. | Structured-pack fixtures compare archive paths and bytes plus source contents across success, missing/corrupt lexical assets, source loss and abandoned locks. Markdown preparation now uses no-maintenance setup and its previously excluded regression passes; the five-format budget fixture also preserves source/archive bytes. Human stale-on-read refresh and explicit refresh policies still need contract reconciliation, so this is not universal nonmutation proof. | CLI Partial |
| AP-BOUND-006 | MUST | Non-Goals | Pack does not call external LLMs or rewrite evidence into model-generated summaries. | Code-path audit plus fixture proving pack output is derived from selected evidence only. | Planned |
| AP-BOUND-007 | MUST | Non-Goals | Pack never auto-downloads semantic models; missing models must use truthful lexical fallback or semantic errors. | Missing-model fixture that checks no model artifact is created and no acquisition path runs. | Planned |
| AP-BOUND-008 | MUST | Non-Goals | Pack does not run hidden `doctor --fix`, manual index repair, or quarantine garbage collection. | `structured_pack_refuses_unreadable_lexical_assets_without_repair` preserves the full archive snapshot and requires an actionable separate index command. Other output modes remain to reconcile. | CLI Partial |
| AP-BOUND-009 | MUST | Non-Goals | Pack does not delete or clean up derived assets while preparing output. | Structured-pack success/refusal and abandoned-lock fixtures require unchanged archive paths and bytes. Other output modes remain to reconcile. | CLI Partial |
| AP-GATE-001 | MUST | Verification Commands | `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/tmp/cass-answer-pack-target cargo fmt --check` is part of closeout. | Implementation closeout evidence. | Planned |
| AP-GATE-002 | MUST | Verification Commands | `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/tmp/cass-answer-pack-target cargo check --all-targets` is part of closeout. | Implementation closeout evidence. | Planned |

| AP-GATE-005 | MUST | Verification Commands | Golden robot JSON/docs tests run through `rch exec` and reviewed diffs. | Implementation closeout evidence. | Planned |
| AP-GATE-006 | MUST | Verification Commands | Intentional golden updates use `UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 rch exec -- ...` and reviewed `tests/golden/` diffs. | Implementation closeout evidence. | Planned |

## Harness Shape

Use three layers:

1. Planner unit tests in the planner module for deterministic scoring,
   duplicate/omission handling, source diversity, freshness, and token budgets.
2. Robot golden tests alongside `tests/golden/robot/` and
   `tests/golden/robot_docs/` for schema, formatting, docs, and introspect.
3. A no-mock CLI integration fixture under `tests/` that creates real temporary
   session data, indexes it through the normal path, runs `cass pack --json`, and
   verifies citations resolve without mutating source logs.

## Planner Unit Evidence

The original planner-only proof set lives in `src/search/pack_planner.rs`:

| Test | Rows Informed | Limit |
|------|---------------|-------|
| `empty_corpus_returns_empty_plan` | AP-CMD-010, AP-ERR-003 | Planner only; command error/default behavior still needs robot fixtures. |
| `duplicate_content_is_omitted_after_first_selection` | AP-SEL-006, AP-OMIT-003 | Covers content-hash duplicates only. |
| `exact_token_budget_boundary_selects_until_budget_exhausted` | AP-OMIT-004 | Covers exact excerpt-budget exhaustion only, not AP-BUDGET-005's serialized-output bound. |
| `source_diversity_changes_second_pick` | AP-SEL-005 | Covers planner selection, not rendered diagnostics. |
| `strict_freshness_omits_stale_or_unknown_timestamps` | AP-SEL-004 | Covers strict policy omission, not prefer-recent tie order. |
| `lexical_score_drives_relevance_when_semantic_is_absent` | AP-SCHEMA-003, AP-HEALTH-004 | Planner score proof only; realized mode/fallback metadata still needs command fixtures. |
| `stable_tie_breaks_do_not_depend_on_input_order` | AP-SEL-003 | Covers source-path stability only. |

## Focused CLI and Renderer Evidence (2026-09-05)

Bead `coding_agent_session_search-2l1b0.20` records the commands, failures and
remaining TODOs. The isolated RCH run in
`/tmp/cass-pack-repair-gate-20260905-r.log` verified source-content SHA-256
`80ae0231bf80f6e16735c106ccefe86fcf2eb12e9e2bada326df733d96f06a25`.
Formatting and all-target clippy passed. The 194 selected test executions were:

- 45 planner/renderer tests, including credential truncation, Unicode token
  accounting, emitted-excerpt SHA-256, missing/ambiguous/oversized sources,
  CRLF, symlinks and FIFOs.
- 3 structured-pack CLI tests for real physical citations and unchanged archive
  assets; 13 CLI pack/alias/timeout tests. The aliases index a real temporary
  Codex auth record and require the exact excerpt and verified source path.
- 2 pack golden tests, 4 budget contract tests plus 59 shared test-utility tests,
  and 68 standard robot JSON/docs golden tests. No golden was regenerated.

UBS remained blocking (`STAGE=ubs EXIT=1`); the full finding set was not waived
or certified as false positives. These are temporary-fixture correctness
results, not an owner-archive performance result or independent review.
The partial rows above do not increase the full-contract coverage totals.

The canonical-source rerun, `/tmp/cass-pack-repair-gate-20260905-s.log`, completed
at 2026-09-05 03:27:43 UTC against commit `63ab2b15` and source-content SHA-256
`d9433a36b0b57fcfa907aedb36047387932dbf7935dfda42840350b0f5d0adc6`.
Formatting, all-target clippy and all 198 selected test executions passed: the
194 above plus four semantic-loader candidate-probe regressions. UBS remained
blocking on the three files changed by that commit (151 critical labels, 2,647
warnings); the earlier seven-file scan also remains unresolved. These differing
scan scopes are not evidence of fewer defects. The gate additionally reported
`source-stability EXIT=1`: concurrent commits changed only Beads notes and this
matrix, with no changes to the verified build inputs. The complete gate is red;
neither this rerun nor the documentation update closes the original acceptance.

The citation-ID/projection run, `/tmp/cass-pack-citation-id-gate-20260905-x.log`,
completed at 2026-09-05 07:27:46 UTC with source-content SHA-256
`6363ae661badcd938d6db87c45da16c4e84ff2e0c25eabfab0125e97d7964340`.
All-target clippy and all 198 selected executions passed: 49 pack unit tests,
3 structured-pack integration tests, 13 CLI pack tests, 2 pack goldens,
4 budget contracts plus 59 utility tests, and 68 standard goldens. The gate
remained red: two test-formatting differences, unresolved UBS findings on two
whole Rust files (106 critical labels, 956 warnings), and a checkout-stability
failure after concurrent commits. The compiled-input digest was rechecked
unchanged after those commits. The known Markdown preparation mutation was
excluded from that structured-pack run. It was subsequently fixed in canonical
source after reservation and included in gate AD below. No golden was regenerated.

The excerpt-shortening and ingestion-redacted citation fixes passed gate AB's
203 selected executions on 2026-09-06, including the new real CLI regression
that failed in gate AA. Formatting and all-target clippy passed. Receipt:
`/tmp/cass-pack-excerpt-budget-gate-20260906-ab.log`, source-content SHA-256
`2e970b0661bcee410cd40e554ccdac19ed81aebd69e0438c0358209bc0526a0f`.
The complete gate remains red: UBS reported 108 critical labels and 1,089
warnings across the two whole Rust files, and concurrent commits triggered the
checkout-stability check. The current build-input digest still matches the
tested digest. No golden was regenerated or finding waived. These tests cover
excerpt budgeting, not the complete serialized-output limit. Gate AD below adds
that separate final-output coverage.

The final-output admission and Markdown preparation fixes passed gate AD's 216
selected test executions: 64 library tests, 6 real pack CLI integration tests,
13 CLI pack tests, 2 pack goldens, 4 budget contracts plus 59 shared utility
tests, and 68 standard goldens. All-target clippy passed. Receipt:
`/tmp/cass-pack-output-budget-gate-20260906-ad.log`, completed 2026-09-06
02:19:38 UTC on `vmi1149989`, source-content SHA-256
`fe98a33290d4e3d7826dc5813801ed7fb22d28bf613483771d664f92aa1de94d`.
The prior AC attempt's one TOON numeric-accessor assertion failure is retained;
AD corrects the test's numeric comparison without removing its output-bound,
original-source verification or byte-stability assertions.

AD remains a red gate: one formatting wrap failed, UBS reported 979 critical
labels and 8,689 warnings across four whole Rust files, and the post-test wrap
correction triggered checkout instability. The sole subsequent source change
was that whitespace-only correction. Final remote `cargo fmt --check` passed
on `vmi1227854` in `/tmp/cass-pack-output-budget-fmt-20260906-ai.log`; its four
source-file hashes match the working tree, whose complete build-input SHA-256 is
`8af8ba70f5ac69268e19165805350fcae8c790e5f74a8f836321062d983f7f94`.
Earlier formatter attempts AE through AH did not execute remotely: incompatible
flags, an inherited sixteen-job allocation, then worker pressure prevented
admission. None is credited as validation. UBS findings remain blocking; no
suppression, golden regeneration, complete-conformance or performance claim.

## Known Draft Gaps

The full-digest base32 change passed gate Z's 199 selected executions on
2026-09-05, with formatting and all-target clippy also passing. The receipt is
`/tmp/cass-pack-base32-gate-20260905-z.log`, source-content SHA-256
`5f36758a65b5e9eb81151680a12e234f9b2b99edc8ed01c2d30e3872b7929b3a`.
The complete gate remains red: UBS reported 106 critical labels and 975 warnings
on the two whole Rust files, and concurrent commits changed checkout metadata.
The build-input digest was rechecked unchanged afterward. No golden was
regenerated, no finding waived, and no full-contract or performance claim made.

- Planner unit tests cover several selection rows, but they do not by themselves
  satisfy this matrix. Full conformance requires contract coverage across the
  pack command, robot schemas, golden outputs, privacy fixtures and source
  citation resolution.
- Current contract reconciliation remains in progress under
  `coding_agent_session_search-2l1b0.20`; the focused evidence above does not
  close the original acceptance criteria.
- Physical source verification currently supports modern local Codex JSONL
  only, bounded to 8 MiB per file, 32 MiB total and a one-second source deadline.
  Other providers, remote sources and files beyond these bounds retain archived
  evidence with `verified=false` and null physical lines.
- Resolve the contract's citation-path invariance requirement against existing
  home-path redaction, and finish policy flags, field masks, full format envelopes,
  readiness and citation identity/hash coverage. Final serialized-output admission
  now has focused unit/CLI evidence; error vocabulary registration, positive
  goldens and the original whole-contract acceptance remain incomplete.
- The pack conformance gate must not be marked passing from planner unit tests
  alone; robot output and no-mock citation resolution are separate obligations.
- Planner unit rows above were verified against `c9eafb8b` with
  `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/rch_target_olive_pack_planner_review cargo test pack_planner --lib -- --nocapture`
  passing 7/7, but they remain below full contract-surface conformance.
